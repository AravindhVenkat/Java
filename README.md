# Java

I have used the Java Swing Class by importing the java.swing package. Specifically, I have used the JOptionPane to provide input dialog box to the User.

The user guessed number is obtained as input to evaluate if the guessed number is correct(exact), low or high and a tip is given accordingly to proceed further.

Total attempts the user took to guess the right number is returned as output.
